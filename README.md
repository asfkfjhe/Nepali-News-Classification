# Nepali News Classification

## Overview
This repository contains code for classifying Nepali news articles into different categories such as politics, sports, entertainment, tech, and business. The classification is done using various deep learning algorithms like LSTM and GRU.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of Nepali news articles collected from various online sources. Each news article is labeled with one of the predefined categories.

Categories:
- politics
- sports
- entertainment
- tech
- business

## Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the models, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Cleaning : Removing unnecessary symbols
- Tokenization : using NepaliStemmer()
- Stopwords Removal

## Models
### LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is capable of learning long-term dependencies.

### GRU
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is another type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is similar to LSTM but with fewer parameters.
